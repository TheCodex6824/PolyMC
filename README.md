# PolyMC will probably not be receiving updates anymore - [PlaceholderMC](https://github.com/PlaceholderMC/PlaceholderMC) is the replacement (with only the cool devs this time)

PolyMC is a custom launcher for Minecraft that focuses on predictability, long term stability and simplicity.

This is a **fork** of the MultiMC Launcher and not endorsed by MultiMC.

The old README was removed due to the resources contained possibly being compromised.
